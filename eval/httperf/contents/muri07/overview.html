<p> Service-oriented architectures (SOAs) are becoming more common, in
part because they offer great flexibility: complex and dynamic patterns of
interaction between services in different administrative domains are
possible. These same characteristics pose challenges for ensuring
system-wide security. 

<p>The goal of this project is to develop techniques and tools for
managing, enforcing, and maintaining trust relationships in systems with
service-oriented architectures. Our work is based on a broad conception of
SOAs that allows services to interact across a variety of interfaces, in
addition to XML-based interfaces that are commonly associated with SOAs.
Consequently, our results are applicable to many legacy systems, as well
as explicitly service-oriented systems, e.g., Web services.
