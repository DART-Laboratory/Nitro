<H4> Policy-based control of package installation actions </H4>
While existing package managers such as RPM allow a system administrator<br>
to examine package contents and installation scripts in detail, this is a<br>
 cumbersome process and hence seldom undertaken. In contrast, our<br>
approach presents a convenient interface through which a system<br>
administrator can exert control over installation actions that impact<br>
system security or the operation of existing applications.<br>
<br>
<H4>Notification of security relevant behavior of packages</H4>
Our tool conveniently notifies the user of any actions of the package manager<br>
that may affect system security and operability.<br>
<br>
<H4>Operability with changes made outside of package managers</H4><br>
Our approach provides a convenient mechanism to control updates to<br>
manually edited files, files shared among multiple packages, or<br>
more generally, files installed outside the scope of the package manager.<br>
<br>
<H4> Normal-user installation of packages</H4> Individual users often want to install packages that are of interest to themselves. Since all RPM<br>
installation actions require super-user privilege, normal users are unable<br>
to install such packages for themselves. Our approach can support this<br>
capability through the use of security policies that limit installation<br>
actions so that the changes are restricted to a specific user directory.<br>
(still under testing, not shipped with current release 1.0).
<H4>Tolerance to failures</H4> Existing package managers offer poor support<br>
to revert  to original system configuration when an installation<br>
upgrade/process fails. Our automatic recovery mechanism<br>
reverts the system  to its original (consistent) state.
