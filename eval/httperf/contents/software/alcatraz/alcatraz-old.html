<hr>

The goal of Alcatraz is to enable <em> safe execution of untrusted code.</em>
Unlike sandboxing approches that restrict file access, Alcatraz allows
untrusted code to access the entire file system. This factor
enables most programs to run successfully under Alcatraz, as opposed
to experiencing runtime aborts/exceptions due to security violations.

<p> Alcatraz ensures system integrity by <em>isolating</em> changes made
by untrusted process(es) so that they are invisible to other processes.
This file-level isolation is achieved using <em>isolation contexts</em>,
which can be thought of as a "private copy" of the entire file system. The
untrusted process and all its children run within an isolation context, so
that they all have a consistent view of the system. Isolation contexts are
implemented using a copy-on-write technique, so that their storage
requirements are proportional to the changes made within them, and not to
the size of the entire file system. Performance overheads are modest for
the application domain.

<p>
An important benefit of Alcatraz is that users don't have to specify what
it means for untrusted software to operate correctly or securely. They
simply run the code, and examine the results produced by the code. If the
results are acceptable to them, they are committed to the file system.
Otherwise, all changes made by untrusted code are discarded. This feature
enables Alcatraz to be used beyond the domain of untrusted applications,
e.g., to do a trial installation and testing of software. The test
installation enables a user to assess whether the software solves
the specific problem of interest to them, and address issues such as
interactions with other software installated on the same machine. 

<p>
A beta version of Alcatraz will be available for download shortly. If you
are interested in playing with an alpha version, please send mail to <a
href=mailto:zliang@cs.sunysb.edu>zliang@cs.sunysb.edu</a>. Alcatraz
operates purely at the user level, so you don't need root privileges to
install or run the system.
